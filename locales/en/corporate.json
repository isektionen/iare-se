We can help your company organize events where students can get in touch with you and your business, to gain insight into the future work life. For example, if you want to recruit or advertise, there are many ways to proceed, such as through a traditional lunch lecture, advertising, or promotion. Below, we list our most common contact methods/events, but we are open to new ideas together with you. Please feel free to contact us within the business group, via email at na@iare.nu.",

You give a presentation during lunch (12:15-13:00) for approximately 80 students while they have a simple lunch that you pay for. What you want to talk about in the lecture is entirely up to you and you can also choose the type of food that is served. For example, during the lunch lecture, you can present the company, project or trainee program.",
